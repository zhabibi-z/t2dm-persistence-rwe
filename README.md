## Overview

This real-world evidence (RWE) study applies pharmacoepidemiological methods to characterise comparative treatment persistence across three major antidiabetic drug classes: metformin monotherapy, GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin). The primary endpoint is time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) defined by a 90-day grace period (Lim 2025). Comorbidity burden — measured across 15 SNOMED-mapped conditions — is investigated as a predictor and time-varying modifier of persistence.

The study follows the **STaRT-RWE** structured template, the **OHDSI LegendT2dm** active-comparator new-user cohort design (Schneeweiss 2007, Lund 2015), and is built on the **OMOP CDM v5.4** running on **DuckDB**. A machine-learning (XGBoost + SHAP) module provides 1-year discontinuation prediction. An interactive knowledge graph (streamlit-agraph) encodes drug–disease–comorbidity relationships, and a LangChain + Groq chatbot (Llama 3.3 70B) enables natural-language querying.

## Cohort Design

The study uses a **new-user active-comparator design** (Schneeweiss 2007, Lund 2015):

- **New-user design:** Patients are enrolled at their first dispensing of a study drug, after a 365-day washout period with no prior use of any study class. This eliminates prevalent-user bias by ensuring all patients have the same opportunity to experience early tolerability events.
- **Active comparator:** Metformin serves as the reference class. Comparing GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i directly to metformin (rather than to a non-initiator control) reduces confounding by indication — both groups are actively managed T2DM patients who qualified for pharmacotherapy.
- **Mutually exclusive cohorts:** Patients are assigned to the first drug class dispensed after T2DM diagnosis. If a patient initiated metformin before GLP-1, they are a metformin new-user.
- **1:5 PS matching:** Propensity scores estimated from logistic regression on age, sex, CCI, and 15 comorbidity flags. Nearest-neighbour matching without replacement, caliper 0.20 SD (Austin 2011).

## Key Results (v2.0 — 30,000 Patients)

| Drug Class | n (pre-match) | n (matched) | Median TTD (days) | Discontinued (%) |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|---:|---:|
| Metformin  | 17,928 | 17,928 | **392** | 92.5% |
| GLP-1 RA   | 5,955  | 5,955  | **261** | 94.9% |
| SGLT-2i    | 6,117  | 6,117  | **317** | 94.5% |

- **Cox TTD:** Drug class significant predictor (HR=1.130 per class, p=1.5×10⁻⁷⁰); drug_class_num z≈8.4
- **R Cox:** GLP-1 HR=1.50 vs metformin (p=2.6×10⁻¹⁵²), SGLT-2i HR=1.23 (p=7.8×10⁻⁴²)
- **XGBoost:** 5-fold CV AUROC = **0.961 ± 0.001**, F1 = 0.909 ± 0.001
- **Top permutation importance:** `followup_days` (AUC drop 0.446), `days_since_t2dm_dx` (0.006), `age_at_index` (0.006), `drug_class_num` (0.001)
- **Knowledge graph:** 19 nodes, 27 edges — now interactive in Streamlit (streamlit-agraph)
- **Kruskal-Wallis TTD:** H=1034.3, p≈0 — all pairwise Dunn comparisons p < 10⁻³³

> **AUC = 0.961 is driven by a Synthea data-generating artifact, not clinical predictive signal.**
>
> **Root cause — `followup_days` leakage:** The Synthea generator sets `obs_end = disc_date + Uniform(120, 300)`, where `disc_date = index_date + ttd_days`. This means `followup_days ≈ ttd_days + noise` (Pearson r = 0.972). Since the outcome is `y = (ttd_days ≤ 365)`, the model reconstructs the target from `followup_days` alone: a logistic regression on `followup_days` only achieves AUC = 0.948; XGBoost on `followup_days` only achieves AUC = 0.951. In real-world claims data, `obs_end` is set by study design (e.g., study end date), not derived from the patient's discontinuation date — so this leakage does not exist.
>
> **Drug class is not the primary driver:** An ablation removing only `followup_days` (keeping all other features including drug class) drops AUC from 0.961 to **0.574**. Drug class alone (without `followup_days`) achieves AUC = **0.578** — consistent with the lognormal TTD parameter differences across classes but far below 0.961. Removing both `followup_days` and drug class yields AUC = **0.503** (essentially random), confirming no other feature carries real predictive signal in this synthetic dataset.
>
> **Expected real-world performance:** Without the `followup_days` leakage, and with non-deterministic prescribing behavior in real claims data, expected AUC for 1-year T2DM treatment discontinuation prediction is **0.70–0.80**. See notebook 04 (`04_ml_xgboost_shap.ipynb`) for the full ablation study and permutation importance analysis.
